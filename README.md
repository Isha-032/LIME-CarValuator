# 🚗 LIME-CarValuator

**LIME-CarValuator** is a Machine Learning–based car price prediction project that not only forecasts the price of used cars, but also explains **why** those prices are predicted using **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)**. This ensures model transparency and builds trust with users.


## 📌 Features

- End-to-end ML pipeline: loading data, preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- Models used: **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**
- Visualizations for data understanding and feature importance
- **LIME explainability** to interpret individual predictions
- Clean, well-documented Jupyter Notebook (`car_price_prediction.ipynb`)


## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- LIME
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔍 What is LIME?

**LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** helps explain **why** your ML model made a particular prediction. It works by perturbing the input and observing changes in prediction to understand the influence of each feature.
